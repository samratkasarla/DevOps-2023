Task-update 09.jan.2023 -WIP
- Merged balanceSheet/sprint011023 -> qa-release/sprint011023 

- checked docker logs ,there are errors. It seems it is because of dockerfile that i have used in my demo angular project.
- It is a multistage dockerfile. Working on Errors due Dockerfile.

Branch creation:
release branch - kartik / you will create from previous release branch
qa - default branch for qa server, to QA person test ( kartik will update qa branch with release branch code )
qa-release/sprint - Once above step done, You will create this branch from qa
then
sprint branches - you will create these from qa-release/sprint as per BA, Lead instruction
then
task branches - developer's will create this from respective sprint branches, once you done with above steps

MR creation
developer will raise MR to sprint branch >>>>>>> Lead will merge
developer will raise MR to dev >>>>>>>>>>>>>>Lead will merge
then auto-deployment will happen, so developer, BA will do test in dev environment
once all worked fine,  then BA/Lead will come to you

devops will raise MR to sprint branch to qa-reelase >>>>>>>>> devops will merge

then lead will send this sprint branch to BA ( just for record )

then qa-release/sprint branch will be deployed by kartik in qa server

BA / Lead will send list of release note based on sprint branch merge to QA
QA will do test in qa server
